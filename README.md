Ark of Games
===

A set of games (hangman, minesweeper and spite&amp;malice) implemented in C and ncurses, as part of a course project.

This game was developed during the first year in Informatics Engineering, in the context of *Laboratórios de informática II* (in 2007). 

Prerequisites
---
In order to compile the project you must have the gcc tool, as well as the lib ncurses (and ncurses dev).

On MacOS lib ncurses is already installed.

On ubuntu, install with:

	$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
	
I haven't compiled it on Windows (I guess it should be straightforward with Cygwin).

Compilation
---
Just open a terminal and compile with make:

	$ make
	
Run
---
Run as any other application:

	$ ./arcadejogos
